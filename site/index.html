            Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by
            the various other "longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted
            to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD!
            This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time,
            I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed.
            Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities
            editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing.
            It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long.
            Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get
            lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool.
            Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word
            "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans
            Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a
            language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel,
            move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins
            with a vowel, you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles"
            becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the
            fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time.
            I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking
            it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's
            never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be
            pretty funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently,
            and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains
            popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun
            than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring.
            This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually
            it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later,
            who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep
            writing until it is the longest! Have you ever heard the song
            "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on
            YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It
            drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my
            sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She
            hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak
            besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that.
            Whatever. I think I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now.
            I'm gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text.
            I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name.
            I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I think it was "FROG"
            in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but
            I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know
            anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning
            it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's this language that was
            made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A
            lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is
            probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get
            it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably
            get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two
            interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought
            you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since
            I'm a young furry, I can't really do as much as I would like to do in the
            fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry
            conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry
            you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very
            desperate for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching
            nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This one time,
            me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't
            end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises,
            and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a
            crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay,
            hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I don't care
            if you're a furry reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to
            torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the
            rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that
            I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which
            I have not used throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year
            will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy
            that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories
            . In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go.
            I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona
            is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since man

            I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed.
            Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities
            editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing.
            It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long.
            Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get
            lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool.
            Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word
            "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans
            Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a
            language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel,
            move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins
            with a vowel, you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles"
            becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the
            fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time.
            I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking
            it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's
            never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be
            pretty funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently,
            and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains
            popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun
            than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring.
            This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually
            it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later,
            who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep
            writing until it is the longest! Have you ever heard the song
            "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on
            YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It
            drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my
            sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She
            hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak
            besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that.
            Whatever. I think I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now.
            I'm gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text.
            I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name.
            I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I think it was "FROG"
            in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but
            I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know
            anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning
            it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's this language that was
            made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A
            lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is
            probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get
            it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably
            get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two
            interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought
            you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since
            I'm a young furry, I can't really do as much as I would like to do in the
            fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry
            conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry
            you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very
            desperate for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching
            nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This one time,
            me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't
            end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises,
            and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a
            crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay,
            hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I don't care
            if you're a furry reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to
            torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the
            rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that
            I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which
            I have not used throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year
            will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy
            that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories
            . In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go.
            I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona
            is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since man

            Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by
